## Overview

This project is a comprehensive solution for video processing and machine learning. It allows users to download videos from YouTube, process them using OpenCV, and apply machine learning techniques with TensorFlow.

## Features

- Download videos from YouTube using Pafy.
- Extract frames from videos using OpenCV.
- Build and train machine learning models using TensorFlow.
- Visualize data with Matplotlib.
- Flexible and modular codebase for easy extension.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pafy youtube-dl moviepy opencv-python
